\section{Preface}

The methods used in this analyses are drawn heavily/almost entirely from Bendix Carstensen 
(see \cite{MaglianoLDE2021,CarstensenSTATMED2007}). \\
To generate this document, the Stata package texdoc \cite{Jann2016Stata} was used, which is 
available from: \color{blue} \url{http://repec.sowi.unibe.ch/stata/texdoc/} \color{black} (accessed 14 November 2022). The 
final Stata do file and this pdf are available at: \color{blue} \url{https://github.com/jimb0w/YO} \color{black}.
The ordinal colour schemes used are \emph{inferno} and \emph{viridis} from the
\emph{viridis} package \cite{GarnierR2021}.

\section{Crude rates}

We start by examining crude incidence rates for each country.
We will generate a table showing the overall counts for each country, then plots of the crude incidence
of each type of diabetes by sex and year. 
Also, because the diabetes type definitions require two years of non-insulin use to
be effective, we will drop all data from 2021 or later.

\section{Age and sex-specific rates}
\label{asrsec}

For the analyses, we are going to use Carstensen's Age-Period-Cohort model \cite{CarstensenSTATMED2007}
to estimate the age and sex-specific incidence of type 2 diabetes for each country. For this, 
we take the incidence and person-years in 5-year age groups, and fit a Poisson model with spline effects
of age, period (calendar time; measured from 2010 (i.e., 2010 is set to 0)), and cohort (calendar time minus age). 
This is done separately for each country and sex. Moreover, because of the different years covered by each dataset,
the knot locations are different for each country (and knot placement is as recommended by Harrell \cite{Harrell2001Springer} 
for period and cohort effects).

Next, we check these models have fit the data appropriately by investigating the Pearson residuals. 
Then, we use this model to predict the incidence of diabetes by age and calendar time. 
These results are presented in figures showing the 
incidence of type 2 diabetes for each country.

To make comparison between countries easier, we will plot all curves for age 25 on the same graph 
(and 20 and 30, to see if there is any difference depending on the age selected; figures ~\ref{agespec20} - ~\ref{agespec30}).

For these plots, we no longer use an ordinal colour scheme. We're using rainbow.

\section{Age-standardized rates}


Additionally, we will age-standardise the incidence rates to the European population in 2010. 
This will be done using the same Age-Period-Cohort models described above. In this analysis, we will take
the predicted rates from these models (in single years) and use these in direct standardisation. However,
to do this, we first need to convert the European standard population (available only in 5-year age groups)
to 1-year age groups (using linear regression).

\color{Blue4}

    \centering

    \label{ESP2010P}
\end{figure}
\begin{stlog}\input{log/8.log.tex}\end{stlog}
\color{black}

\clearpage

With that, we can calculate and plot the age-standardized rates.
Note: the method used to calculate the confidence intervals is the 
same as the Stata command \href{https://www.stata.com/manuals/rdstdize.pdf}{dstdize}, and it assumes that the person-years
are the same for each single age within the 5-year age group (which, if the 
populations we sample from are anything like the European population, is 
a safe assumption (figure~\ref{ESP2010P}, and is unlikely to affect the calculated
error even if included)).

\color{black}

\section{Average Annual Percent Changes}

As a summary metric, we will also estimate the average annual percent change
in incidence - overall, and by sex. For this, we use a different model with a spline effect
of age, but only a (log-)linear effect of calendar time. This means we are assuming the effect of time
is constant throughout follow-up, which we already know is false for a few countries (e.g., Australia;
figure~\ref{agespec25}). \\

        every last row/.style={after row=\bottomrule},
    ]{APCs.csv}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

It's also worth looking at variation in the incidence rates by age, as some of the figures in section~\ref{asrsec}
suggested a greater increase in type 2 diabetes at younger ages. For this, we will use two models: 
the first includes the interaction between a spline effect of age and a log-linear effect of calendar time (plotted in the left
panels of the combined figures),
whereas the second includes a spline effect of age and the product of log-linear effects of age and calendar time (plotted on the right in the figures).

    \caption{Annual percent change in the incidence of diabetes in Hungary by age, by diabetes type and sex. Values are predicted from a Poisson model with a spline effect of attained age, a log-linear effect of calendar time, and an interaction between age and calendar time. The left panels use a spline term for age in the interaction, the right panels use the product of age and calendar time in the interaction.}
